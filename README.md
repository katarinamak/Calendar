I believe that one of the keys to success is time management and organization. I keep all of my important dates in my agenda and every morning I create a to-do list for the day containing every task I have no matter how big or small. While this system has worked for me for years, I find myself spending more time than I would like simply planning what I have to do and how I am going to do it rather than just getting it done. I couldn't help but think that there is a more efficient way of maintaining this system. Thus, I decided to put my technical skills to use and make a good old reliable calendar - but better.

As a computer science student and a student living in a post-pandemic world, I spend at least 95% of my life on my laptop. By switching to an online calendar, I know I will always have access to my calendar and schedule without having to remember to keep track of yet another notebook. Furthermore, with a virtual calendar, I can get reminders of important deadlines, birthdays, and upcoming events in the form of desktop notifications.

Another feature I am currently working on implementing is the ability to generate a to-do list on a daily and eventually weekly basis. When saving a date to the calendar, the user can specify how many days in advance they should start working on a task, and by doing so the calendar will add it to their to-do list as the deadline approaches. This saves time from planning the task and makes it easy to get an idea of what's coming up, especially if you have a very busy schedule.

I implemented the calendar using Python, specifically using tkinter for the GUI, and I am storing the important dates in a database which is managed using MySQL.

As I continue to elaborate on this project, I will make it increasingly customizable, and add features that will support a healthy work-life balance such as hourly reminders to take a break from staring at your computer screen, or daily reminders to go for a walk or get some physical activity.

I hope to create a powerful tool that will help busy students such as myself manage their time and work more efficiently.
